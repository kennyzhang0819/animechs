/**
 * THE GROUND TILES — the game's own floor art, painted rather than loaded.
 *
 * The floors used to be Mindustry's: a 32px tile of two colours with a
 * fifth of its pixels flipped to the second one at random, three numbered
 * variants a floor. That speckle is the most recognisable thing about
 * Mindustry's ground, and the first thing to change if the game is to
 * look like itself.
 *
 * A tile here is 16 logical pixels across, drawn 2× into the same 32px
 * cell the atlas and the menu already expect, so everything downstream —
 * the antialias pass, the edge fades, the 64px atlas cells — is untouched.
 * The coarser grid is the point: a chunkier pixel reads as a different
 * hand. On it a floor is a flat base colour and a FEW things — one or two
 * soft patches a shade off the base, a ripple, a crack, at most one
 * pebble — never a field of dots. Two variants a floor, not three; the
 * third slot every table still has draws the first again.
 *
 * Everything is deterministic: a (kind, variant) pair paints the same
 * pixels every time, in the browser and in the script that writes the
 * editor's palette icons (scripts/gen-tiles.mjs). Nothing here touches the
 * DOM until `floorCanvas` is called, so the map module can import the
 * tones for its thumbnails on the server.

 * edge (WALL_SHADOW_A, and the same pass on the menu).
